# Starwars Multi-Threading Simulation
 Microservice framework, Multi-Threading, Testing, Java Project. In this project I made a simulation in which each Star-Wars character ( Han Solo, Leia, R2D2, C3PO, Lando) is an isolated thread and they all communicate via a Bus singleton thread-safe object, and use shared objects Ewoks, in order to destroy the death star.
